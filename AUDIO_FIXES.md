# Audio Conversation Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Audio Format Problem ‚úÖ

**Problem**: The application was sending WebM/Opus encoded audio data instead of raw PCM that Eleven Labs expects.

**Solution**:

- Replaced MediaRecorder with real-time audio processing using AudioWorklet/ScriptProcessor
- Converts audio to 16-bit PCM at 16kHz sample rate
- Sends raw PCM data as base64 to Eleven Labs

### 2. Sample Rate Mismatch ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Recording at 44.1kHz but Eleven Labs expects 16kHz or 22.05kHz.

**Solution**:

- Changed recording sample rate to 16kHz for optimal compatibility
- Updated playback to handle 22.05kHz audio from Eleven Labs

### 3. Audio Processing Pipeline ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Audio chunks were being processed incorrectly.

**Solution**:

- Implemented real-time PCM conversion in audio processing
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Enhanced audio chunk debugging

### 4. Connection and Conversation Flow ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Conversation initiation might not work properly for audio mode.

**Solution**:

- Added better conversation mode tracking
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Improved error handling

## How to Test

1. **Setup Environment**:

   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your API key
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add: VITE_ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY=sk_your_key_here
   ```

2. **Start the Application**:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Test Steps**:
   - Open browser to http://localhost:5174
   - Select an agent from dropdown
   - Click "Connect"
   - Click "üß™ Test" to send a test message
   - Click "üé§" to start voice recording
   - Speak into microphone
   - Click "üé§" again to stop recording
   - Should receive audio response from agent

## Debugging

Check browser console for detailed logs:

- üé§ Audio recording start/stop
- üì¶ Audio chunk processing
- üîä Audio playback
- üîó WebSocket connection events
- ‚úÖ Success indicators
- ‚ùå Error messages

## What Changed

### Audio Manager (`src/hooks/useAudioManager.ts`)

- Replaced MediaRecorder with AudioWorklet/ScriptProcessor
- Real-time PCM conversion at 16kHz
- Better error handling and logging

### Eleven Labs Service (`src/services/elevenLabsService.ts`)

- Enhanced audio chunk sending with debugging
- Better conversation mode tracking

### Chat Interface (`src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`)

- Added test button for debugging
- Better error messages
- Enhanced audio chunk handling

### New Files

- `public/audio-processor.js` - AudioWorklet for PCM conversion
- `src/utils/audioTest.ts` - Testing utilities
- `.env.example` - Environment template

## Common Issues

1. **"Failed to access microphone"**: Grant microphone permissions in browser
2. **No audio chunks**: Check console for PCM conversion logs
3. **Connection failed**: Verify API key and agent ID
4. **No response**: Check if agent is properly configured in Eleven Labs dashboard

The application now sends proper PCM audio data to Eleven Labs and should work for audio conversations!
